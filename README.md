Ansible-New-Relic-Plugins
========================

Ansible playbook which will install the New Relic, MySQL and Nginx monitor. Since New Relic only has pre-configured automated installs with Puppet and Chef, I had to create these by myself.

I currently have more of them in the works, which I will release once they're done.


What's included?

- Java installation
- New Relic system monitor
- New Relic php monitor
- New Relic Nginx plugin
- New Relic MySQL plugin (not working yet)


How do I use this?

1. Download repo
2. cd to the directory
3. vagrant up

Wait and enjoy the automated installation :)
