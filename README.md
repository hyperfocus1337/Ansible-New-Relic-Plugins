Ansible-New-Relic-Plugins
========================

Ansible playbook which will install the New Relic, MySQL and Nginx monitor. Since New Relic only has pre-configured automated installs with Puppet and Chef, I had to create these by myself.

I currently have more of them in the work, which I will release once they're done.
